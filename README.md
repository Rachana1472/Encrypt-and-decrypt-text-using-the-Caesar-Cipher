# Encrypt-and-decrypt-text-using-the-Caesar-Cipher
The Caesar Cipher project, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, encrypts and decrypts text by shifting letters of the alphabet by a chosen key. Users can enter a message and shift value to encode or decode instantly. It demonstrates classical cryptography, string manipulation, and DOM handling in a simple web interface.
